# Copy this file to 'config' and fill in your credentials:
#   cp config.example config
#
# Finding the trusted-cert hash:
#   Run openfortivpn once without trusted-cert. It will fail but print:
#     ERROR: Gateway certificate validation failed, and the certificate
#     digest is not in the local whitelist. If you trust it, rerun with:
#       --trusted-cert <hash>
#   Copy that hash into the trusted-cert field below.
