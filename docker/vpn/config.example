# openfortivpn configuration for university VPN

# Copy this file to 'config' and fill in your credentials:
#   cp config.example config
#
# Finding the trusted-cert hash:
#   Run openfortivpn once without trusted-cert. It will fail but print:
#     ERROR: Gateway certificate validation failed, and the certificate
#     digest is not in the local whitelist. If you trust it, rerun with:
#       --trusted-cert <hash>
#   Copy that hash into the trusted-cert field below.

# Frankfurt University VPN (example):
#   host = vpn.uni-frankfurt.de
#   port = 443
# =============================================================================

host = vpn.your-university.de
port = 443
realm = pub-all
username = your_username
password = your_password

# SSL verification (pick one):
# Option A: Certificate hash from first connection attempt (see instructions above)
# trusted-cert = 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
# Option B: CA certificate file (e.g. from university IT, mounted into container)
# ca-file = /etc/ssl/certs/your-ca.crt
