# Build-time conformance gate for the workspace browser stack.
# =============================================================================
#
# Both workspace images must satisfy this identical contract:
#   - docker/Dockerfile.workspace   (container workspace)
#   - docker/agent-vm-base/         (VM golden image, asserted in stage2)
#
# This file is SHARED rather than duplicated on purpose. The two images are
# hand-maintained twins, and the VM shipped for ~5 weeks with a working Chromium
# that no agent could reach: browser-exec and browser-use were added to the
# container only. Nothing asserted the images agreed, so every VM-backed job
# silently degraded to "No renderer available" static-only verification.
# See knowledge-base/knowledge/issues/vm_workspace_missing_browser_exec.md.
#
# A per-image assertion would not have caught that — adding a capability to one
# image and its own private assert leaves the other image silently short. A
# shared gate fails the build of whichever image lacks the capability. When you
# add to the browser stack, add it HERE, and expect both builds to fail until
# both images install it. That failure is the feature.
#
# Usage: assert-browser-stack.sh   (exits non-zero with a diagnostic on failure)
# =============================================================================

# Run from a directory every user can traverse. browser_use reads `./.env` at
# import time (pydantic-settings), and stat'ing it from an unreadable CWD
# raises EACCES — which reads as "browser_use not importable". Exactly that
# failed every stage2 VM build: provision-stage2.sh invokes this gate as
# `sudo -u agent-host` from /home/packer, which is 0750 on Ubuntu 24.04
# (Noble made home dirs private), so agent-host could not stat `./.env`.
