"""``POST /api/projects`` on an installation with no cloud, and no forge.

R1.B01 recorded that a minimal profile — no Gitea, no main cloud — answered
``POST /api/projects`` with a **500 after the project and owner-membership rows
were already written**, and explicitly refused to count that as a passing
project-create gate. R1.B03 owns the endpoint, so it owned the defect.

The failure was never the forge. With Gitea disabled the endpoint skips
knowledge-repo provisioning through a guard that is already there
(``forge.is_initialized``);
``test_disabled_forge_alone_does_not_fail_project_create``
isolates that and is the control for everything else here. The 500 came from
the *cloud* step: ``ensure_project_cloud_resources`` called
``main_cloud_router.for_owner()`` outside its own ``try``, and that raises
``FeatureNotAvailable`` when no active backend instance has been bound — while
every other remote effect in the helper is wrapped and logs, and the sibling
``for_project_optional`` branch returns the project unchanged.

**Intended degraded behaviour**, now implemented: a cloudless installation
creates the project and simply gets no cloud resources. That is what the
optional tier means everywhere else in this codebase, and it is the only
outcome that does not leave a row the caller was told did not exist. The
refusal inside ``for_owner`` is *kept* — guessing an installation is the
failure that refusal exists to prevent; only the caller's handling changed.

A real failure must still be a real failure, so
``test_a_genuine_store_failure_still_surfaces`` pins that the blanket 500 has
not been turned into a blanket swallow.

Re-pointed by R1.B03 lane P at the extracted owner
(``orchestrator.services.projects.create_project`` over
``orchestrator.services.project_provisioning``), which is where the endpoint's
body now lives. Every assertion is the one written against ``orchestrator.main``
and means the same thing: the collaborators that used to be patched module
globals are now injected values, so the fakes are handed in rather than
monkeypatched, and the caller's identity is supplied directly instead of
through the gate the router owns.
