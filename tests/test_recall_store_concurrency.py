"""Real-Postgres concurrency tests for RecallStore's deadlock containment.

Guards knowledge-base/knowledge/issues/project_scoped_memory_deadlocks_under_parallel_jobs.md: five
same-project jobs racing ``decrement_ttl`` (scope-wide UPDATE) against the
access-stat write (``id = ANY(...)`` UPDATE in RRF-score order) produced 138
contained retrieval deadlocks — PostgreSQL acquired the overlapping tuple locks
in divergent orders. The containment fix locks in deterministic id order.

**A mock cannot fail this way.** Lock-order cycles exist only inside a real
lock manager, so these run two RecallStores over separate connection pools
against a real pgvector container with the real vector migrations, and assert
via ``memory_health`` that nothing was contained.
