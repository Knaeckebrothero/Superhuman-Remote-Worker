"""F5 — multi-tenancy gates on project knowledge endpoints.

Covers:
    GET    /api/projects/{id}/knowledge/summary
    GET    /api/projects/{id}/knowledge
    GET    /api/projects/{id}/knowledge/{note_id}
    POST   /api/projects/{id}/knowledge/search
    PATCH  /api/projects/{id}/knowledge/{note_id}
    DELETE /api/projects/{id}/knowledge/{note_id}
    POST   /api/projects/{id}/knowledge/export

All seven require viewer-or-higher project membership. Tests focus on the
gate itself: cross-user 403, missing-project 404, member-passes-and-hits-the-
inner-code. We don't exercise the vector-DB / Neo4j paths beyond confirming
the gate fired (an inner 500 / 503 after the gate counts as success — it
proves the gate let the caller through).
