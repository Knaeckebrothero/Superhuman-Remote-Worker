"""Officer slot roster — typed worker allocations for centurion sessions.

The flat ``officer.max_concurrent_workers`` cap answers "how many workers
may he run"; slots answer "what KIND of workers does he command". The
Legate assigns a kit at provision time::

    officer:
      enabled: true
      slots:
        line:  {count: 2, model: "MiniMax-M3", backend: "sandbox"}
        heavy: {count: 1, model: "gpt-5.6-sol", backend: "vm"}

and the officer names a slot per dispatch (``create_job(...,
slot="heavy")``). The job-creation funnel stamps the slot's model/backend
onto the job config server-side — the officer chooses WHICH troops to send,
never what they are made of. An explicit per-job model/backend that disagrees
with the selected slot is rejected by the authoritative admission service
before job or ticket-claim insertion; compatible/defaulted requests receive
this patch. Per-slot count is enforced under the
durable Officer Post row lock (knowledge-base/knowledge/features/centurion.md §6).

Pure module by design: validation and admission are plain functions over
dicts so they unit-test without the FastAPI app. ``main.py`` owns the HTTP
translation (ValueError → 400 at provision, SlotAdmissionError → 409 at
job create). Slots are an ALLOCATION system, not a privilege one — the
capability-grant PDP (model_selection, can_use_vm) still gates the stamped
config downstream, so a slot can never exceed what its owner may grant.
