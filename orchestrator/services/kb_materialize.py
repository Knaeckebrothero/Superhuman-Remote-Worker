"""Server-side materialisation of ONE knowledge note into a project's KB repo.

Step 3 of ``knowledge-base/knowledge/features/knowledge_base_repo_separation.md``. The agent used
to materialise every note as ``knowledge/<slug>.md`` inside its own workspace
checkout (``_dual_write_note``), which welded the vault to the jobs repo and,
because it was guarded on ``has_git()``, skipped entirely for anything without
git — persistent sessions, lite tiers, repo-less projects — leaving those
notes pathless and therefore invisible to ``kb_read`` / ``kb_search``. The
write moves here instead: one note, one Gitea commit, into whichever repo §5's
``resolve_kb_repo`` picks for the project.

Nothing downstream changes. Files stay canonical, the reindexer still ingests
``knowledge/**/*.md`` from git on its next sweep and sets ``path``, and reads
keep their ``path IS NOT NULL`` gate. Only the *writer* moved, from the agent's
workspace checkout to a commit the orchestrator makes.

By contract this **never raises for an expected condition**. Every outcome —
including "there is no repo" and "Gitea refused" — comes back as a status dict,
but mutation callers must fail closed unless that result proves the desired
bytes crossed the canonical repository boundary. The durable intent ledger
keeps a failed write visible and retryable instead of allowing an index-only
success.

        job_id: Writing job, for per-job commit attribution (§3). Optional —

          readable).
        * ``failed`` — the note is NOT materialised. ``reason`` is one of
          ``invalid-slug``, ``empty-content``, ``resolve-error``,
          ``no-repo``, ``commit-refused``, ``commit-error``. ``no-repo`` (the
          project has no Gitea repo at all) is **permanent** — a repo-less
          project cannot grow one by retrying, so the caller
          (``_materialize_note_canonical``) resolves the repo *before*
          opening a durable intent and returns this outcome unrecorded; this
          branch only fires if that early resolution raised and a same-call
          retry then answers definitively "no repo".

        Never raises. A ``failed`` result means canonical durability was not
