"""Mode A baseline seeding + diff capture for the job cloud workflow.

See ``knowledge-history/done/job_cloud_export.md`` §3 for the design. This module
owns the cloud→Gitea seed at job-start and the Gitea-diff capture at
job-completion. Both run from the orchestrator side; the agent stays
unchanged (it picks the seeded ``projects/<slug>/`` up via its existing
clone-on-start of the job's Gitea repo).

The seed is async via ``asyncio.create_task`` from the job-create
handler. While it runs, the job carries
``context.cloud_baseline = {state: 'seeding'}``; the dispatcher gate
in ``get_dispatchable_jobs`` skips jobs in that state so the agent
never starts on an incomplete baseline.

Compatibility limitation:

* Ordinary human-reviewed Mode A jobs retain the original text-only baseline
  behavior. Strict loop baselines include binary files byte-for-byte because a
  file-producing loop cannot silently start from an incomplete project folder.

Both the OpenCloud and Nextcloud backends implement the byte-level
project-folder methods this module relies on
(``list_project_folder`` / ``get_project_folder_file_bytes`` /
``put_project_folder_file_bytes`` / ``delete_project_folder_file``), so
Mode A works on either active backend.
