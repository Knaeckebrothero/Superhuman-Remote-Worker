"""Work categories — the contract a ticket carries, independent of who runs it.

The loop spent a month producing tested Python and no UI. The cause was not a
gate rejecting design work; it was that no design ticket was ever *proposed*.
Roles were the vocabulary (scholar, critic, developer), each job inferred its own
definition of done, and the cheapest way to look finished was another verifiable
module. Nothing in the machinery said "an answer is a deliverable" or "a
screenshot is evidence", so nothing produced them.

This module supplies the missing half of the model
(knowledge-base/knowledge/features/officer_backlog_pools.md §2-§3):

    category = a property of the WORK  — what shape the deliverable takes,
                                          what counts as evidence, when to stop
    expert   = a property of the WORKER — what skills it brings

The two are many-to-many on purpose. A developer given "compare rendering A vs B"
is a *researcher* on that ticket: throwaway code, a decision note with numbers.
The same developer given "implement the winner" is an *executor*: files under
``projects/<slug>/``, evidence that fits the claim. One expert, two contracts,
because the contract belongs to the ticket.

Three categories, and the parallelism rule that falls out of them: researchers
and testers write to the knowledge base and can run concurrently; executors touch
shared project state and are serialized (§5.5). That generalizes the old
name-based ``LOOP_ANALYSIS_ROLES`` split without replacing it — legacy loops keep
their name-based checks, deliberately (§2).

**Effort ceilings are posture, not caps.** Each block states how big its job is
allowed to be and that bigger discoveries become follow-up tickets. No mechanical
per-ticket budget or wall-clock cap is set anywhere in this feature (§13.4): the
officer is the brake. The blocks therefore have to carry that discipline in
words, which is why they say so explicitly rather than leaving it implied.

Pure module: constants and string composition, no I/O, no database. The tick
(B3) and the kickoff builder (B5) are its callers.
