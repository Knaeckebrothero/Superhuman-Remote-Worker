"""Single source of agent config resolution (supersedes agent-side Decision 6).

Composes ``src/core/loader`` steps so the orchestrator produces the full, frozen
config blob the agent hydrates. Reused by job dispatch AND session attach —
identical resolution; only timing/delivery differ. See
``knowledge-base/knowledge/superpowers/specs/2026-06-17-orchestrator-resolved-config-design.md``.

Pure + synchronous: no DB, no network. The caller fetches the expert row and
passes it in; injects credentials into the *delivery* copy afterwards (the
serialized blob is already free of ``llm.api_key``); and strips any remaining
secrets with ``redact_config_override`` before persisting.

    Layer order (global_expert_management.md:246-260, most-specific wins)::

        bundled base -> base_defaults -> expert fragment
        -> project_experts.config_override -> DB config_overrides (0022)
        -> user persistent_agent settings -> request config_override

    The ``subagents.roster`` is materialised AFTER those layers (so a request
    override's ``subagents.roster.<name>.llm.model`` deep-merges into the
    entry first) and BEFORE the capture / grant strip (so the PDP sees the
    resolved entries, not ``{$ref: critic}``). ``db_refs`` is the caller's
    prefetched ``{expert_uuid: row}`` map for UUID ``$ref``s; an entry that
    cannot be resolved is dropped and recorded in ``agent._roster_warnings``
    — dispatch never fails a job over its roster.

    ``base_defaults`` sits just above the bundled base and *below* the expert:
    use it for the system/user **default model** selection (model names only), so
    the base config's placeholder model is replaced by the real default while an
    expert or request override still wins. Transport (base_url/api_key) for the
    final model is injected into the delivery copy by ``inject_blob_credentials``.

    The returned blob carries NO credentials (``serialize_resolved_config``
    strips ``llm.api_key``); the caller injects creds into the delivery copy and
    strips the rest before persisting.

    ``expert_type`` is the ROLE the config is resolved for (``worker`` /
    ``session`` / ``subagent``): the bundled base's ``$extends`` chain is
    re-rooted onto that role's overlay (``expert_base <- overlays/<role> <-
    expert``, universal_experts_and_subagents.md §1.1), so a session expert
    resolves as a worker for a job and vice versa. When ``base_config_name``
    is itself a chain root (``worker_base`` / ``session_base`` / ...) the role
    wins over the name — the roots are one thing in different roles. Any other
    string keeps the chain's own root (call-site intent only, as before).

    ``grant_strip``, when given, runs on the fully-merged ``data`` before BOTH
    ``capture`` and the returned blob are built from it — so the PDP's capture
    and the blob the agent hydrates always agree. Applying it only to
    ``capture`` would silence the dispatch check while still delivering the
    stripped capability.

    # injector's setdefault, so endpoint-backed phase pins (e.g. codex models)
    # shipped without transport and 401'd against api.openai.com while the
    # base model — whose top-level None WAS stripped — worked, masking the gap
