"""Text-to-speech with optional LLM-based formulation.

Two-step pipeline used by the persistent-chat ``Speak`` button:

1. **Formulation** (auxiliary LLM) — strips markdown, summarizes code
   blocks, converts tables/lists into flowing prose so the TTS output
   sounds natural. Skipped for short or already-clean text.
2. **Synthesis** (TTS model) — generates MP3 via the user's configured
   TTS endpoint (OpenAI-compatible).

Model + endpoint resolution mirrors the dispatcher's per-user chain
(user > project > system). Results are LRU-cached in process so
clicking Play twice on the same message doesn't re-bill.
