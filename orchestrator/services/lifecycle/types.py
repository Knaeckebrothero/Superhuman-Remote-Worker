"""Type and Protocol definitions for unified instance lifecycle management.

The reconciler operates on a ``list[InstanceLifecycleManager]`` registry —
one manager per instance kind (agent, workspace, vm) — and uses only the
methods declared here. Anything not on these Protocols stays inside the
respective manager's implementation.

The kind hierarchy:

    InstanceLifecycleManager       — agents (no per-instance state)
        StatefulInstanceManager    — workspaces, VMs (snapshot-able state)

Type narrowing in the reconciler (``isinstance(mgr, StatefulInstanceManager)``)
gates snapshot/restore calls, so the agent path doesn't need a no-op
snapshot method.
