"""``/api/projects/{project_id}/loop`` — start / inspect / control the project
self-improvement loop.

One active loop per project. **Start** spawns the first job (``role_sequence[0]``,
normally the scholar); the orchestrator's ``_advance_project_loop`` completion
hook drives the Scholar→Critic→Execution rotation from there, one job at a time,
until the iteration / deadline / consecutive-failure budget stops it.

Mirrors ``routers/automations.py`` conventions: handlers reach ``postgres_db``
(and the loop spawn helpers) via late ``from main import ...`` to dodge the
circular import at module load; ACL via ``require_project_member``.
