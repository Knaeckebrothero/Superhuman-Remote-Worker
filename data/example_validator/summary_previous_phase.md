# Summary of Previous Tactical Phase (Phase 4: Verification)

The verification phase validated the final requirements table and ensured compliance with the required format:

- Confirmed the markdown table contains the four required columns **ID**, **Name**, **Description**, **Source**.
- Verified that every row has values for all columns and that the **Name** column was derived from the first clause of each requirement.
- Checked that IDs are unique, sequential (REQ‑001 – REQ‑068), and without gaps.
- Ensured every requirement includes a complete source reference (page and section).
- Produced the final verified table `requirements_table.md` and a concise verification report `verification_report.md`.
- Updated `workspace.md` to reflect verification completion and readiness for hand‑off to the Validator.

All verification objectives were met, and the deliverables are ready for the next stakeholder.
