# Summary of Tactical Phase 4 – Verification

**Objectives**
1. Validate that the final requirements table follows the required four‑column format (ID, Name, Description, Source).
2. Ensure every row contains values for all required columns and that the values are consistent.
3. Verify that IDs are unique and ordered sequentially.
4. Confirm that each requirement includes a complete source reference.
5. Produce the final verified requirements table (`requirements_table.md`).
6. Summarise the verification process and outcome.

**Findings**
- The markdown table in `requirements_selected.md` originally used columns **ID**, **Requirement**, **Source**, **Business Objects**. This did not match the required column set. A new table with the correct columns was generated as `requirements_table.md`.
- All rows now contain **ID**, **Name** (derived from the first clause of each requirement), **Description**, and **Source**.
- IDs range from **REQ‑001** to **REQ‑068**, each appearing exactly once and in sequential order.
- Every requirement includes a source reference (page number and section) – no missing citations were detected.
- The final verified table complies with the validator’s format and is ready for hand‑off.

**Conclusion**
- Table format corrected and validated.
- IDs are unique and ordered.
- Source references are complete.
- Deliverables (`requirements_table.md` and `verification_report.md`) are prepared for the Validator.
