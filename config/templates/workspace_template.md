# Workspace Memory

This file is your persistent memory. It survives context compaction and is included in every system prompt.
Use it to track critical information that you need to remember across the entire task.

**Update this file regularly.** When in doubt, write it down here.

## Status

Track your current position in the plan and overall progress.

- **Phase**: (current phase name)
- **Progress**: (brief progress indicator)
- **Blocked**: (any blockers, or "none")

## Key Decisions

Document decisions AND their reasoning. Future-you needs to understand WHY.
Without reasoning, you may revisit the same decision unnecessarily.

(Example: "Processing pages sequentially rather than by section - cross-references span sections")

## Entities

Track resolved entity IDs, names, and relationships. This is your reference table
for anything you'll need to look up repeatedly.

(Example: "Customer: BO-042 | Invoice: BO-015 | Payment: BO-023")
