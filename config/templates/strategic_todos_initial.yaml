# Strategic todos for job initialization (first strategic phase)
# These todos guide the agent through initial workspace setup,
# plan creation, and first phase todo generation.

      EXPLORE: Read instructions.md to understand the task. List available
      tools in the tools/ directory. Check documents/ for input files.
      Understand the scope before planning. Then PIN critical rules:
      extract core constraints, required output formats, and style
      guidelines from instructions.md and write them to workspace.md
      under a "## Pinned Instructions" section. These survive context
      compaction; the original instructions.md content will not.

      PLAN: Create plan.md with phases to complete the task. For each phase,
      estimate complexity: exploratory/complex (5-10 todos), moderate (10-15),
      or simple/repetitive (15-20). Plans are living documents - they WILL
      be adapted as you learn. Don't over-plan; focus on the first 2-3 phases.

      INITIALIZE workspace.md: Set up the Status section with current phase
      and "Starting" progress. Add any Key Decisions made during planning
      (with reasoning). Add Entities section only if you already identified
      key entities. Keep it minimal - you'll update it after each phase.

      CREATE first phase todos using next_phase_todos. Start conservative:
      prefer 5-10 todos for the first phase to calibrate effort. Include
      a final todo to verify the phase goals were met. You can adjust
      phase sizing in future strategic phases based on how this goes.
