"""Structural gate on which runners this repository's CI is allowed to use.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
This is a PUBLIC repository whose CI runs on self-hosted runners inside the
homelab cluster. Anyone can open a pull request, and for a `pull_request` event
GitHub executes the workflow file *taken from that pull request*. If a job in it
names a self-hosted label, a stranger's code runs on our hardware.

So the rule is deliberately not "be careful when you edit runs-on". The rule is:
there are exactly three legal `runs-on` lines in this repository, and CI refuses
to go green if a fourth appears anywhere. A typo cannot produce a legal line. A
cleverly-equivalent rewrite cannot produce one either — that is the point, not a
limitation. Every routing decision has to be one of three strings a reviewer
recognises on sight, without evaluating an expression.

This is the MERGE-TIME half of the defence. The RUN-TIME half is
docker/ci-runner/job-started-guard.sh, wired up through
ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_STARTED, which lives in the runner image and therefore
cannot be edited by a pull request at all. Neither half is sufficient alone:
this script cannot stop a fork PR that deletes it from RUNNING, and the hook
cannot stop a bad routing change from being MERGED. Check 8 below is what keeps
the two halves tied together.

See policy/ci_self_hosted_runners.md.
