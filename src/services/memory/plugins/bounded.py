"""Bounded-injection policy (memory overhaul Phase 3, slice 3).

Caps how much of the memory channel actually gets injected, in the
post-scorer order. Motivated by the Phase-2/3 eval findings on the seam
arm: ~95% of a multi-session project corpus is TTL-pinned (cross-session
memories freeze once their job scope stops ticking), so the two-tier
read path degenerates to dump-the-store (~236 items / ~9k tokens per
turn) and the reader has to find the answer mid-dump. With a reranker
scorer placing the evidence at first-hit rank ~1.35, a small top-K is
strictly better reading material.

Placement matters: ``memory.budget_tokens`` trims inside the retriever
— in legacy hybrid order, BEFORE scorers run — so a budget cut there
drops the evidence a reranker would have surfaced. This policy is the
post-scorer cut.

Scope discipline:
- Only ``kind == "memory"`` items are capped; knowledge items render to
  their own block and pass through untouched, in position — unless
  ``include_knowledge`` is set (B5): then knowledge items count against
  the same ``max_tokens``, making it the one token budget across the
  memory + KB blocks (the legacy KB block is uncapped on every call).
  ``max_items`` stays a memory-count cap either way — a combined item
  count would starve the KB block behind hundreds of memory candidates.
- Order-preserving: items keep their scored order; the policy only
  drops the overflow.
- Token cap uses the candidate's stored token_count with a chars/4
  estimate as fallback (knowledge candidates deliberately carry 0).
