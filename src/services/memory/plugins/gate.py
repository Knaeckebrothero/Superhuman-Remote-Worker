"""Relevance-gate policy (memory overhaul Phase 3, slice 4).

P4: a memory is injected because it qualifies — and nothing is injected
when nothing qualifies. Below-threshold is not "inject the best of a bad
lot".

Two modes, because the slice-4 measurement falsified the naive design:
- ``absolute``: drop items whose channel score is below ``threshold``.
  Measured on the s20 corpus this LOSES evidence — qwen3-reranker's
  absolute scale varies by orders of magnitude per query (top evidence
  0.9991 on one question, 0.0019 on another), so any absolute cutoff
  that trims one question's filler deletes another's evidence
  (complete_rerank_gate_s20: R@5 0.80 at threshold 0.05).
- ``relative`` (the measured recommendation): drop items scoring below
  ``threshold × top-score-of-this-assemble``. Evidence/distractor
  separation is consistently strong (5–800× on the probed questions)
  even where absolute confidence is tiny, so a per-assemble relative
  floor keeps evidence while shedding filler. Note: relative gating can
  never inject *nothing* (the top item always passes its own floor) —
  the probe showed score magnitude alone cannot distinguish "answerable
  but weakly phrased" from "unanswerable with a topical near-miss", so
  the P4 nothing-qualifies ideal is not reachable from rerank scores;
  it returns with calibrated/ensemble channels.

Fail-open on absence, fail-closed only on evidence: an item the channel
never scored — scorer outage (manager containment passes items through
unscored), candidates past the reranker's ``top_k``, a pinned head kept
by ``keep_pinned_first`` — passes the gate untouched. A reranker outage
therefore degrades to the legacy full dump, never to an empty injection.
Corollary (measured, affe2881 s20): when the reranker's ``top_k`` does
not cover the candidate set, the unscored tail leaks through the gate —
size the channel scorer to full coverage when gating on it, or compose
with ``bounded`` so the leak is capped.

Scope discipline (matches the bounded policy):
- Only ``kind == "memory"`` items are gated; knowledge items render to
  their own block and pass through in position. (A KB gate needs a
  scorer that scores knowledge candidates first — the reranker scorer
  deliberately does not.)
- Order-preserving: survivors keep their scored order.
- Composes with ``bounded``: ``policies: [gate, bounded]`` drops the
  non-qualifying tail first, then caps what remains.
