"""Tool-group policy: an authoring vocabulary that can say "on".

``tools.<category>`` is a list of tool names, and that one field carries two
unrelated facts — **membership** (which tools are in the group) and **policy**
(whether the group is on).  Membership already has an authority:
``TOOL_REGISTRY``, which knows every tool and its category.  Config should
carry policy.

Every registry category has at least one tool, so no group is ever legitimately
empty: every ``[]`` in every config is a disable marker.  That makes "off"
self-describing and "on" inexpressible — re-enabling needs the full member
list, which the caller looks for in the layer it is overriding, which says
``[]``.  Hence the shipped defect: the New Session form can disable a tool
group and can never enable one
(``knowledge-base/knowledge/issues/session_create_tool_toggles_cannot_enable_a_group.md``).

This module is the fix, and it is a **front-end, not a rewrite**.  Five
authoring forms normalise down to the single ``list[str]`` representation the
whole stack already speaks:

===========================  =====================================================
Form                         Resolves to
===========================  =====================================================
``true``                     every config-grantable tool the registry has here
``false``                    ``[]``
``{except: [names]}``        the config-grantable set minus these; tracks the
                             registry
``{only:   [names]}``        exactly these, as written; frozen
``[names]``                  legacy spelling of ``{only: [names]}`` — unchanged
``[]``                       legacy spelling of ``false`` — unchanged
===========================  =====================================================

Both legacy spellings are *already* canonical, so :func:`normalize_tool_policy`
is the **identity function on every declaration that exists today**.  That is
the single most important property here: the enabling commit changes no
resolved tool set anywhere, the eight downstream ``== []`` consumers keep
working untouched, and DB-backed experts need no migration.  It is pinned by
``tests/test_tool_policy.py::TestIdentityProperty`` and by
``tests/test_config_tool_grants_snapshot.py``.

One category is narrower than the table above: **`shell` accepts `only` (or a
bare list) and `false` (or `[]`), and nothing else.** `true` and `except` both
auto-track the registry — `except` is `true` minus a fixed subtraction,
recomputed on every resolution — and a tool added to a code-execution category
must not reach live configs without a diff. See
:data:`ENUMERATE_ONLY_CATEGORIES`.

**Normalisation is layer-local.** Expanding a policy needs only the registry
and the value — never the parent layer.  So it runs per-layer at birth and the
existing ``deep_merge`` "lists replace, dicts merge" semantics carry the whole
layer model unmodified.  A consequence worth stating out loud: a child
``{except: [c]}`` under a parent ``{only: [a, b]}`` resolves to the *whole
category* minus ``c``, which is wider than its parent.  That is intended; see
``TestMergeOrder.test_parent_only_child_except_WIDENS_and_that_is_intended``.

This module is also the **request boundary's** vocabulary — see
:func:`validate_tool_override_fragment`.  Config layers and API requests are
the same kind of object, so they get the same answer to "is this a legal
``tools.<category>`` value, and do these names live in this category?".  The
difference is only what a failure means: a config file raises at load, a
request gets a 400.
