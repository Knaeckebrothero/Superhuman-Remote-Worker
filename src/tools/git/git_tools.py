"""Git tools for the Universal Agent.

Provides read-only git operations over every repository in the workspace:
- git_log: View commit history
- git_show: Inspect specific commits
- git_diff: Compare changes
- git_status: Current workspace state
- git_tags: List phase milestone tags

Each tool reads the job's own repository (context.workspace_manager.git_manager)
by default, and an attached repository datasource
(context.workspace_manager.source_repos[repo]) when given ``repo``.

These tools are bound only when the agent has NO shell tools — a shell can run
git against any repository directly, and granting both gives the agent two ways
to ask one question. See ToolsConfig.__post_init__ in src/core/loader.py.
