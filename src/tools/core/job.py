"""Job lifecycle tools for the Universal Agent.

This module provides completion signaling tools:
- mark_complete: Signals that a task/phase is complete (used by phase transitions)
- job_complete: Marks the phase as final, job completes after remaining todos are done

The job_complete tool implements a final phase pattern (journal-before-observe,
knowledge-base/knowledge/issues/job_finalization_decisions_held_only_in_process_memory.md):
1. Rejects if called from tactical phase (must be in strategic phase)
2. Durably journals the decision on the job row (orchestrator POST, idempotent
   on (job_id, tool_call_id)) BEFORE returning to the model
3. Caches the decision in ``_final_phase_data`` (process cache, not the
   source of truth); the audited tool node mirrors it into graph state
   (``is_final_phase=True`` + ``completion_decision``) so a checkpoint that
   contains the tool result also contains the decision
4. Agent completes remaining strategic todos (summarize, update plan)
5. When all todos complete, on_strategic_phase_complete detects the final
   phase and freezes the job
