"""Mode A job diff review — summary, per-file content, accept and reject.

Extracted verbatim from ``orchestrator.main`` (R1.B04 lane C). Four
properties are load-bearing and moved unchanged:

* **Completion control is an authority, not a policy this module owns.**
  ``guard`` / ``claim`` / ``finish`` / ``abort`` arrive as injected callables
  (port contract §3.2); the *ordering* around them is the contract: the guard
  fires before any gate, the claim is taken after every cheap refusal and
  before the first slow external call, and every failure between the claim
  and the commit aborts it. When the claim is ``None`` (commands disabled)
  the slow calls run without a deadline and the transition degrades to four
  separate store writes — deliberately, because there is no fence to keep.
* **A partial cloud write does not transition the job.** Errors from
  ``apply_diff_to_cloud`` release the claim and 502 with the counts so the
  user can retry; the job stays ``pending_review``.
* **Refusal shape.** The divergence and partial-write refusals carry a dict
  ``detail`` with a ``code``; every other refusal carries a plain string.
  A caller distinguishes them on that shape.
* **The in-memory job row is mutated to match the committed row** before the
  terminal side effects run, because ``_advance_project_loop`` and
  ``apply_terminal_job_side_effects`` read the dict, not the database.
