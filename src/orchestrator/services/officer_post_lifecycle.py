"""The Officer Post's lifecycle: commission, decommission, hold, release, edit.

Extracted verbatim from ``orchestrator.main`` (R1.B07 lane O, census group
``S_OFFICER``; officer_post.md §5/§7, O3/O4).

:func:`decommission_officer_post` is the authoritative commissioned → vacant
transition and the rest of this module funnels through it. PostgreSQL reads the
thread state again under post → thread row locks; the caller's ``thread`` is
identity only. Harvest, wake folding, durable route fallback, one incarnation
append, unlink and the server-owned disable/end are **one transaction**, and
route notification delivery happens only after that commit — a failed notifier
leaves ``user_delivery_at`` null for the reconciler.

Orderings preserved literally:

* **Commission parses the money-spending authority first.** A closed release
  fence is a no-write refusal, not a half-completed commission; the capability
  gate then runs before anything mutates, so a missing
  ``unattended_operations`` grant leaves the kit untouched.
* **A stale ended/disabled link completes its handoff atomically** before a
  successor is prepared — registration never performs a partial fold.
* **The final locked confirmation linearizes the response** against an
  immediately racing decommission: whichever holds the post first defines the
  truthful result.
* **Hold stamps no ``thread_id`` key**, and that absence is what keeps the
  watchdog's stale-conference-hold self-heal from ever releasing a maintenance
  hold.
* **Release refuses while the runtime recycle owns the hold.**
* **Patch writes the durable row always**, merges into thread metadata only
  when commissioned, and never lets ``communication_policy`` touch the thread.

Other batches' authorities arrive as constructed ports and are never
re-implemented here: ``create_thread`` is B06's one session funnel (commission
is a caller of it, not a second create path), ``end_thread_flow`` is B09's
stand-down, and ``deliver_officer_note`` is the wake service's. The release
fence arrives as a nested :class:`OfficerPostPolicyDependencies` so the flag is
read live.
