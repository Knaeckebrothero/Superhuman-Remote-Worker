"""The Officer watchdog — dumb-code guardian of commissioned sessions.

Extracted verbatim from ``orchestrator.main`` (R1.B07 lane O, census group
``S_OFFICER``; centurion.md §4). Three duties, none requiring judgment: file
the implicit ``sleep_max`` timer when an unheld officer has none pending; treat
a pending timer overdue past ``fire_at + grace`` **with a live pod** as a
delivery failure and kick the drain; submit a missing runtime to the shared
durable lifecycle owner. Leader-gated by the application; the recycler also
carries a durable generation/claim.

Two orderings are load-bearing and neither is re-derived here:

* **Runtime authority is maintained before hold/timer decisions.** A held
  Officer is still commissioned and may sleep for days; letting a conference
  hold skip credential maintenance would just move the 24 h cliff to another
  branch.
* **The implicit filing is gated on LAST ENGAGEMENT**, not on ai/tool row age:
  a turn's ai row only lands at turn end, so age alone re-files mid-turn.

This task outlives every request, so it carries its collaborators explicitly on
:class:`OfficerWatchdogDependencies` rather than looking anything up later.
``persistent_thread_recycler`` is a **callable** because the application
assigns that global during startup and the watchdog re-reads it each tick.
