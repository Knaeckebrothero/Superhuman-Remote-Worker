"""Upload files into a persistent thread's live workspace.

Files land in ``<workspace>/uploads/``. Which transport gets them there is
decided by the thread's workspace tier:

- ``sandbox`` / ``vm`` — SFTP into the workspace container or VM (paramiko).
- ``virtual`` — object-store ``put`` under ``threads/<id>/uploads/``, the same
  durable namespace the agent's lite backend is attached to at dispatch, so the
  agent's own ``read_file("uploads/x")`` resolves what we wrote.

``none`` (a disposable agent-local tmpdir) has no orchestrator-reachable
storage and is refused permanently rather than pretending to be transient.

Filenames are sanitized to prevent path traversal and collisions are resolved by
appending a counter.

A ``.zip`` upload is expanded into ``uploads/<stem>/…`` rather than stored as
a single opaque archive, mirroring the worker-job path's ``_extract_zip``
(``src/agent/agent.py:4067``) so an attached archive is immediately readable by
``read_file``/``list_files`` with no unzip capability required. See
``_expand_payloads_for_extraction`` below. When extraction is refused
(corrupt, unsafe entry, over a cap) the archive is stored verbatim under its
own claimed name plus a sidecar ``ZIP_REFUSAL_NOTE_SUFFIX`` file explaining
why — both flow through the normal upload-result plumbing, so they show up
like any other attached file in the HTTP response and the cockpit's
"Attached files:" hint, and ``read_file`` on the archive itself surfaces the
same note (see ``_read_zip_extraction_note`` in
``src/agent/tools/workspace/files.py``).

The agent learns about new uploads when the cockpit appends an
``Attached files: …`` hint to the next user message — see
``persistent-chat.service.ts``.

Uploads can also be removed again (``delete_file_from_thread_workspace``,
behind ``DELETE .../uploads/{path:path}``), because the cockpit uploads
*eagerly* — on attach, before the user commits to sending. Removing an
attachment chip therefore has to be able to remove bytes that already
landed. That path's whole security burden sits in ``_safe_upload_relpath``.

    primitive — SFTP will ``remove`` any path the ``agent-host`` user can
    write, and the object store will delete any key under the prefix, so
    the check can never be delegated to the remote.

    ``relpath`` is relative to ``uploads/`` itself — ``"report.pdf"``, or
    ``"bundle/sub/a.txt"`` for a zip-extracted member — i.e. exactly

    Posture is ``_safe_zip_member_path``'s, not ``_sanitize_filename``'s:

    - ``_sanitize_filename`` is unusable here. It flattens to
      ``PurePosixPath(name).name``, which destroys the ``bundle/sub/a.txt``
      shape an extracted member legitimately has — and, worse, a *sanitized*
      traversal is a delete silently redirected at some other file rather
      than a refusal.
    - ``posixpath.normpath`` runs BEFORE the prefix check, so
      ``uploads/../../.ssh/authorized_keys`` is resolved and then rejected
      instead of passing a naive "starts with uploads/" test.
    - Confinement is to the uploads *subdirectory*, not to the thread
      prefix, which is shared: Canvas writes thread state at
      ``threads/<id>/<path>`` (``services/canvas_files.py:1034``) and tool
      files live alongside it.

    Rejects: empty, NUL, absolute (leading ``/``), any backslash, a Windows

    ``"bundle/.."`` — removing one attachment never means removing the
    directory), and anything normalizing outside it.
