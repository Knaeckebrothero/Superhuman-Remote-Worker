"""Usage and workforce reporting reads over the metering ledger.

Every operation here answers "what did this cost / how is the fleet doing"
from already-materialized rows. Nothing writes: the ledger is stamped by
``services/audit_usage.py`` and ``services/workspace_metering.py``, sealed by
the infrastructure-metering package, and only read back here.

Three shapes recur and are deliberately not collapsed into one:

* **The window.** ``usage_events`` is partitioned on ``ts``, so a read without
  a range is a confident zero rather than an error. Per-job reads derive their
  window from the job; the aggregate reads take it from the caller.
* **Unpriced is not free.** ``cost.usd`` stays ``None`` until some row carries
  a price, and ``cost.complete`` says whether every metered event had a rate.
* **Availability is not emptiness.** ``available=False`` / ``state`` values
  distinguish "the audit tier is off", "this predates the ledger anchor", and
  "this really spent nothing".

Collaborators arrive through :class:`UsageReportingDependencies`, resolved per
request by the application, because every metering singleton is assigned during
startup and is ``None`` at import.
