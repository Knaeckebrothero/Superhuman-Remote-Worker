"""The Officer's conference: one open embodiment per project, and its hold.

Extracted verbatim from ``orchestrator.main`` (R1.B07 lane O, census group
``S_OFFICER``; centurion.md §2/§4, officer_visibility_streamline.md §3.1).

A conference is the standing Officer's *embodiment* — a normal interactive
session wearing his identity via ``officer.conference``, with
``officer.enabled`` still false on it. The rules that travel with it:

* **One open conference per project** is the single-writer rule (§2):
  :func:`find_open_conference_thread` is what the create path reattaches to
  instead of minting a rival. An authorized retirement is irrevocable, so a
  thread with ``runtime_retirement_authorized_at`` set no longer counts
  whatever its status column says — otherwise a stuck retirement would lock the
  project out of conferences for as long as it stays stuck.
* **The conference thinks with his brain** (:func:`inherit_conference_brain`):
  request-provided ``llm`` keys win, absent ones are filled from the standing
  officer. Never raises — a vacant post means today's behaviour.
* **The hold is uniform** (:func:`hold_officer_for_conference`): the wake-claim
  query skips held threads entirely and the watchdog stands down. The live
  stand-by notice is best effort on top of that, not the mechanism.
* **Concluding is idempotent** (:func:`conclude_conference_if_any`): the brief
  wake dedups on the conference thread id, so the end hook and the watchdog's
  self-heal can both run. Never raises.
