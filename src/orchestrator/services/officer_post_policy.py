"""Officer Post editing policy: the patch validator and its vocabulary.

Extracted verbatim from ``orchestrator.main`` (R1.B07 lane O, census group
``S_OFFICER``; officer_post.md §7). This module is deliberately pure — it makes
no store call and takes no side effect — because a typo'd kit must fail *here*,
on the same hard line the session-create funnel draws, and that rule has to be
testable without a database.

What travels with it:

* :data:`OFFICER_POST_EFFECTS` — §7's per-field honesty table, shown in the UI.
  It is also the accepted-field vocabulary: anything outside it is a 400.
* :func:`validated_officer_post_patch` — one partial edit (PATCH body or
  commission body — same shape) → ``(config_fragment, communication_policy
  patch, effects)``. Null-as-clear is preserved per field, and
  ``communication_policy: null`` is still refused with its explanation.
* :func:`enforce_officer_auto_pull_release` — the deployment release fence for
  unattended enablement. Callers pass the *effective* commissioned value, so a
  post enabled before a rollback cannot be recommissioned behind a dark fence;
  the historical truthy shapes (``"true"``, ``1``) are fenced too.
* :func:`check_officer_sleep_bounds` — min ≤ max over the MERGED view.
* :data:`OFFICER_CONFIG_NAME` / :data:`OFFICER_PERMISSION_MODE` — the two
  commission-time facts whose absence each cost a live incarnation its whole
  job surface (2026-08-15); their comments are the record of that.
* :func:`format_legate_note` and :data:`OFFICER_NOTE_MAX_CHARS` — the Legate
  channel's authorship stamp and bound.

The release fence is the one runtime value, and it arrives as a **callable** on
:class:`OfficerPostPolicyDependencies` because it is a B11-owned import-time
flag that suites rebind on ``orchestrator.main`` (§P1).
