"""Operator controls over the VM workspace tier.

Extracted verbatim from ``orchestrator.main`` (R1.B05 lane P, census group
``R_GRANTS``). Two decisions, both about the VM tier and neither about
capability grants:

* :func:`check_vm_permission` — may this principal get a VM at all? A global
  kill-switch in ``system_settings`` blocks EVERYONE including admins; a
  non-admin additionally needs ``can_use_vm``. This is the operator gate that
  runs *alongside* the ``vm_workspace`` capability grant, never instead of it.
* :func:`vm_needs_release` — does a stored VM context still own cluster
  resources worth reclaiming?

Properties moved unchanged:

* **The kill-switch is checked before the admin bypass.** Reordering those two
  would let an admin provision a VM on a deployment that has globally disabled
  them.
* **``enabled is False`` is the only disabling value.** An absent or malformed
  settings row reads as enabled (fail-open for fresh installs), and a DB read
  failure is logged and deferred to the per-user check rather than being fatal.
* **Falsy context is NOT "needs release".** ``vm_needs_release`` is a denylist
  over ``status``; without the leading truthiness test an entity that never had
  a VM would pass the denylist and fire a spurious teardown.

The setting key is imported from ``system_settings`` rather than re-spelled, so
this gate and the admin CRUD surface can never read two different rows.
