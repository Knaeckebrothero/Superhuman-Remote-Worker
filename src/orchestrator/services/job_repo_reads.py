"""Read-only Gitea proxy for a job's workspace repository.

Extracted verbatim from ``orchestrator.main`` (R1.B04 lane C). Three
properties are load-bearing and moved unchanged:

* **The caller never sees Gitea credentials.** Every operation goes through
  the application's forge client, which owns the token; the cockpit asks for
  a job id and gets file/commit/tag data back.
* **Refusal order.** Authorization (``require_job_access``) is completed by
  the HTTP adapter *before* any of these operations runs, and each one then
  checks forge availability (503) before resolving the repo. A repo that
  cannot be resolved raises out of ``resolve_job_repo`` — the operations do
  not catch it.
* **The job's branch is the default ref.** ``ref or job_branch`` on the
  content reads, and ``sha if sha != "main" else (job_branch or sha)`` on the
  commit listing: a subjob asking for the literal default lands on its own
  branch, not on the root job's ``main``.
