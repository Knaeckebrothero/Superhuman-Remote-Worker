"""OpenRouter model-pricing sync → ``usage_rates`` (LLM $/token rates).

The in-process metering path materializes cost-free LLM token rows into
``usage_events`` from the ``llm_requests`` audit trail; this module seeds the
effective-dated ``usage_rates`` table so :meth:`UsageLedger.record_events` prices
those rows at write time.

Source: OpenRouter's public model catalog (``openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`` — no
auth), which publishes per-model ``pricing.prompt`` / ``pricing.completion`` /
``pricing.input_cache_read`` as USD-*per-token* decimal strings.

Mapping: each catalog model resolves to an OpenRouter price by its admin-set
``params_json.pricing_id`` (Admin → Models) when present, else by the model id
itself. Resolution (``_build_price_resolver``) tries an exact (case-insensitive)
match on the full OpenRouter id, then the once-stripped remainder as a full id
(the gateway case: ``openrouter/openai/gpt-oss-120b`` → ``openai/gpt-oss-120b``),
then as a bare suffix — so a bare ``gpt-5.6-terra`` auto-matches
``openai/gpt-5.6-terra`` with no admin mapping. A suffix shared by more than one
provider is treated as ambiguous and left unpriced (fail closed) rather than
mis-priced against the wrong provider.
``pricing_id = ""`` marks a model explicitly unpriced (self-hosted / free) → no
rate → ``cost_usd`` stays NULL.

Effective-dated + change-only: a sync inserts a NEW ``usage_rates`` row only when
the upstream price differs from the current newest rate for that (resource, unit),
so re-running every N minutes never bloats the effective-dated table and never
rewrites already-snapshotted history. Non-fatal throughout (network/DB errors log
and no-op) — same graceful-degradation posture as the rest of the metering tier.
