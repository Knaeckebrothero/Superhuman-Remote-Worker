"""HTTP adapters for the Mode A job diff review surface.

Route order is part of the contract: ``/api/jobs/{job_id}/diff`` is declared
before ``/api/jobs/{job_id}/diff/{file_path:path}`` so the summary keeps
winning over the greedy per-file path.

Every route is gated by ``require_job_access``, which enforces both user
visibility AND the MCP/officer ``project:<uuid>`` scope. The gate returns the
row and the operation works on *that* row — the accept/reject paths mutate it
in place before running the terminal side effects, so re-reading the job here
would break the effect chain.
