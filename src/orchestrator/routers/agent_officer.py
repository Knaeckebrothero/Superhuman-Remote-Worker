"""``/api/agents/threads/{thread_id}/officer/...`` — the Officer's own routes.

Extracted from ``orchestrator.main`` (R1.B07 lane O). Two internal route
declarations, moved with their handler names, paths, methods, parameter order
and docstrings intact. Neither carried ``tags``, ``response_model``,
``status_code`` or a ``dependencies`` list, and neither acquires one here; the
internal-key gate is called in the declaration body exactly where it ran
before.
