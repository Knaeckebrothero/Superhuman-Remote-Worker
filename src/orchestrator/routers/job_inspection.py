    Exists because a parent's own status is not self-explanatory. ``waiting``
    means *blocked on a child* (``_spawn_scholar_job`` holds the parent there
    while the scholar runs), so a reader looking at a ``waiting`` row is looking
    at the one status that cannot be understood without its children — and the
    jobs list is exactly where they are missing. Paging is over display roots
    and children ride along only if they *also* match the filter, so under the
    default ``origin IN ('user','session')`` a subjob never does. The row shows
    a parked-looking parent and no children whatsoever.

    So this deliberately does **not** reuse the list's query. It walks the tree
    (``get_job_subjob_roster``), which makes the answer independent of the
    caller's filters: the roster of a job is a property of the job, not of the
    view someone is looking at it through.

    Authorization is the parent's. A subjob inherits its parent's project and
    owner at creation, so seeing the parent is seeing the family, and every
    field returned is one ``GET /api/jobs`` already publishes for a child that
    the filter happened to let through.

    ``count`` is the honest size of the tree — the number the list's own
    ``childCount`` cannot give, because that one counts what survived filtering.

    The sibling of ``GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/subjobs`` for the in-process
    children: a ``delegate_agent`` call runs a child session inside the
    parent's pod, and the only durable trace is its ``threads`` row of
    ``kind='subagent'`` (0206) plus the transcript in ``thread_messages``.
    Those rows are deliberately kept off the sessions page (``list_threads``
    filters on kind), so this is the one place a reader sees them — with
    ``thread_id`` linking to ``/sessions/<thread_id>``, where the ordinary
    thread endpoints render the transcript read-only.

    Like the subjob roster it takes no filter parameters: the children of a
    job are a property of the job, not of the view someone reads it through,
    and terminal children are the ones that explain the parent's diff.

    Authorization is the parent's (``require_job_access``): a child row
    inherits the job's owner and project at creation, so seeing the job is
    seeing its children — the same rule that lets the job owner open the
    child's transcript through ``require_thread_owner``.
