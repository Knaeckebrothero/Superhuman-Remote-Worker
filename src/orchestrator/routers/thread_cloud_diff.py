"""HTTP adapters for the protected-cloud diff review surface (Slice C, Task 8).

Five routes, one gate. ``require_thread_owner`` is awaited first on every one
of them — before the protected-mode check, before any mount row is read — so
the ordering of refusals is unchanged: a non-owner never learns whether the
thread is protected, and a non-protected thread answers 404 rather than 403.

Route order is part of the contract: ``GET .../cloud-diff`` is declared before
``GET .../cloud-diff/{file_path:path}``, and the three POST verbs keep the
positions they had in ``main``.

The owner gate returns ``(user, thread)``; only the thread row travels into the
operations, which re-derive metadata themselves.
