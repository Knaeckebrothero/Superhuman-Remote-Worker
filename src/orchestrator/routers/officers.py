"""``/api/officers`` and ``/api/projects/{project_id}/officer`` — the Post.

Extracted from ``orchestrator.main`` (R1.B07 lane O). Nine route declarations,
moved with their handler names, paths, methods, parameter order and docstrings
intact — the docstring is the published OpenAPI description, so it is part of
the route's identity and not editorial text.

None of the nine carried ``tags``, ``response_model``, ``status_code`` or a
``dependencies`` list, and none acquires one here. Each gate is called in the
declaration body exactly where it ran before: ``scripts/check_endpoint_auth.py``
reads the audited gate from the route it is declared on and does not follow a
call into a service module. The resolved principal (and, for commission, the
resolved project) is handed down so this is the same single membership read it
always was.
