"""HTTP adapter for agent registration, heartbeat and the fleet admin reads.

Extracted from ``orchestrator.main`` (R1.B06, lane C, census group ``S_REG``).
Seven routes, in their pre-extraction declaration order.

Nothing but the path, method, handler name, return annotation and — for
``/api/agents/register`` — the explicit ``response_model`` is declared here.
No ``tags=``, no ``operation_id=``, no ``status_code=``, no route-level
``dependencies=``: the declarations this replaces carried none, and each would
change the published OpenAPI operation for a route this batch must leave
byte-identical. ``list_agents`` keeps its ``Query`` defaults verbatim, bounds
included, because those bounds are the published request contract.

**The access gate is called here, as the handler's first statement**, exactly as
it was in the application module. That placement is load-bearing twice over: it
preserves the pre-extraction ordering (nothing is read or written before the
refusal), and it is where ``scripts/check_endpoint_auth.py`` reads the audited
gate identity for ``policy/endpoint_inventory.txt``. A gate hidden one call
deeper would classify these routes as ``unscoped``.
