    Reads the ``usage_events`` ledger rather than re-aggregating ``llm_requests``:
    the materializer already normalizes tokens out of three different homes, and
    a fresh aggregator reproduces the bug where Responses-API rows (``token_usage
    = {}`` plus a NULL ``metadata``) meter as nothing — one job lost ~17.3M tokens
    that way before the fallbacks landed (``services/audit_usage.py``).

    Three things this endpoint owns that ``GET /api/usage?ref_id=`` does not:

    * **The window.** ``usage_events`` is partitioned on ``ts``, so every read
      needs a range and a caller who picks the wrong one gets a confident zero:
      ``/api/usage?ref_id=<job>&days=1`` reports ``total_cost_usd: 0`` with
      ``available: true`` for a job that cost $0.94 a week earlier. Here the
      window comes from the job itself, and its tail is *now* rather than
      ``completed_at`` — workspace-pod intervals close at teardown and async
      auxiliary calls (memory extraction, summarization) land after the job
      seals, so a window that ends at completion loses real spend.
    * **Unpriced is not free.** ``cost.usd`` is null until something is priced,
      and ``cost.complete`` says whether every metered event carried a rate. The
      shared ``query_usage`` COALESCEs the sum to 0.0, which is why unpriced
      workspace compute currently renders as costing nothing.
    * **Three empty states, not one.** ``no_usage`` (really spent nothing),
      ``predates_ledger`` (created before the materializer's forward-only anchor,
      so it has no rows and never will), ``unavailable`` (audit tier off). Only
      the first is a zero.

    ``include_subjobs=true`` sums the job and every descendant, terminal ones
    included — the honest total for a parent row in a list that pages over
    display roots, where children ride along with their parent. Default is the
    job's own spend.
