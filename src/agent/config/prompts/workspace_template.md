# Workspace Memory

This file is your persistent memory. It survives context compaction and is included in every system prompt.
Use it to track critical information that you need to remember across the entire task.

**Update this file regularly.** When in doubt, write it down here.

## Status

Track your current position in the plan and overall progress.

- **Phase**: (current phase name)
- **Progress**: (brief progress indicator)
- **Blocked**: (any blockers, or "none")

## Accomplishments

Record completed milestones. Focus on outcomes, not individual steps.
This helps you (and reviewers) understand what has been achieved.

(Example: "Completed Phase 1 - extracted 23 requirements from 45 pages")

## Key Decisions

Document decisions AND their reasoning. Future-you needs to understand WHY.
Without reasoning, you may revisit the same decision unnecessarily.

(Example: "Processing pages sequentially rather than by section - cross-references span sections")

## Entities

Track resolved entity IDs, names, and relationships. This is your reference table
for anything you'll need to look up repeatedly.

(Example: "Customer: BO-042 | Invoice: BO-015 | Payment: BO-023")

## Notes

Working observations, reminders, and anything that doesn't fit above.
Keep this section lean - move stable information to appropriate sections.

(Example: "Page 12 has OCR issues - interpreted 'Aufbewahrungsfrist' manually")
