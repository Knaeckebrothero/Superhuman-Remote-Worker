Based on the instructions, create a structured plan in markdown format.

The plan should have:
1. A clear goal statement
2. Numbered phases (## Phase 1, ## Phase 2, etc.)
3. Each phase should have specific, actionable steps
4. Mark initial status as "pending" for each phase

Format example:
```markdown
# Plan: [Goal Summary]

## Goal
[Clear statement of what needs to be accomplished]

## Phase 1: [Phase Name]
Status: pending

Steps:
- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2

## Phase 2: [Phase Name]
Status: pending

Steps:
- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2
```

Create the plan now. Be specific and actionable.
