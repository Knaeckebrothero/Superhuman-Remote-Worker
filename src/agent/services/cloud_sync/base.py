"""Base class for cloud-agnostic workspace sync.

The sync algorithm (walk workspace, diff against last-known state, push
modified files, poll for remote changes, honor ignore patterns) lives here
exactly once. Per-backend subclasses implement four transport primitives —
mkdir, upload, list, download — so the same algorithm runs for Nextcloud
WebDAV + basic auth, OpenCloud WebDAV + bearer token, or any future
transport (e.g. MS Graph for OneDrive).
