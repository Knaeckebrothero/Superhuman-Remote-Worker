"""Cross-backend workspace seeding — copy every file from one backend to another.

Used by the workspace-tier upgrade (``workspace_tier_upgrade.md`` §4.2 S3a for
sessions, §4.3 W1 for worker jobs): when a lite (``virtual``) session/job
upgrades to a real ``sandbox`` container, the agent copies the object-store
prefix down into the freshly provisioned pod while BOTH backends are live. It
is a pure in-process copy — the agent already holds the object-store
credentials (lite internal creds never leave the agent process), so no
orchestrator transfer is involved.
