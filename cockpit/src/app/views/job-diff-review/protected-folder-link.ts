 *   showing anything (`folderLinkMatches`).
 * - a `source_ref` is required, because without a project id there is nothing
 *   to resolve a browser URL from.
 *
 * Row order is load-bearing: the backend query is `ORDER BY target_path` and
 * the REST projection preserves it, so "first match" means the same row on
