/**
 * Client-side mirror of the loader's `normalize_llm_tiers` (src/core/loader.py)
 * for a config the cockpit is about to read or edit.
 *
 * U1 collapsed the per-phase model tiers: an expert has one `llm.model`, and
 * the subagent reader model lives at `subagents.llm`. A fragment authored
 * before that (a stored DB expert, an old `config_override`) still carries
 * `llm.strategic` / `llm.tactical` / `llm.subagent`; the server maps them at
 * every seam it reads through, but the expert detail's merged `config` and the
 * export bundle's raw fragment arrive as stored. This lifts them the same way
 * so a legacy fragment prefills the single-model controls correctly and is
 * saved back in the new shape:
 *
 *  - **Layer-local** (default; a fragment at birth): when the fragment sets no
 *    `llm.model` of its own, the chosen phase block (strategic first; tactical
 *    only without a strategic block; a block carrying a `model` is preferred
 *    over a params-only one) is deep-merged into `llm`. An explicit
 *    `llm.model` wins and the phase blocks are dropped — the July "phase pin
 *    shadowed the selected model" rule.
 *  - **Merged** (`merged: true`; a base ⊕ fragment dict such as the detail's
 *    `config`): `strategic.model` > `tactical.model` > `model`, faithful to
 *    what the old `get_phase_config("strategic")` ran — the base's placeholder
 *    `llm.model` must not shadow the expert's pin here.
 *
 * Under both rules `llm.subagent` moves to `subagents.llm` unless the fragment
 * already authors one, and the legacy keys are deleted. Never mutates the
 * input; a fragment without legacy keys is returned by identity.
