 * is set on success or the BFF login redirect has already been kicked off.
 *
 * If for whatever reason `currentUser` is still null when the guard runs
 * (race between component activation and a delayed initializer resolution),
 * we wait one effect tick for the next non-null emission, then fall back to
 * sending the user to login.
